# PalestraFitness

## Description

Palestra Fitness is an Android Application made for a local Gym in Santa Fe - Argentina. It provides the user the possibility to have a gym routine on a mobile phone instead of writing it on paper.

**Status of the app**

Currently, the app is working as a prototype. There is a to-do list to finish before an alpha release could be made:

* Change the log-in method from username-password to mail-password to increase the security of the database.
* Add a password remember functionality.
* Add a "view routine mode" so the gym can have the app on a public tablet and the user doesn't need to log in every time that he wants to see the routine.

## To-Do

### Features expected in short-term

* Build the first alpha version adding basic features.
* Add multi-routine support.

### Features expected in mid-term

* Add English language to the app.

### Features expected in long-term

* Add a "template" mode.
* Add pre-defined exercises.
